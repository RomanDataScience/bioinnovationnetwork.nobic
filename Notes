1. Carto "Positron" (The "Apple Maps" look)

This is a light, grayscale map. It is perfect if you want your Purple and Grass Green markers to be the absolute stars of the show. It looks incredibly high-end and clean.

}).addTo(map);

2. Carto "Dark Matter" (The "Tech" look)

If you want a dark mode map, this is the gold standard. The blue connecting lines will look like glowing neon against this background.

1. Carto Positron (Light & Minimal)

This is the "Apple Maps" style. It is the cleanest option and makes your purple and green markers stand out perfectly.

}).addTo(map);

2. Carto Dark Matter (High-Tech Dark Mode)

If you want a modern, "command center" feel. The blue connecting lines will look like neon lights against this background.

}).addTo(map);

4. Carto Voyager (Soft & Colorful)

This is a middle ground—it has more color than Positron (parks are green, water is soft blue) but is still much cleaner than standard OpenStreetMap.
